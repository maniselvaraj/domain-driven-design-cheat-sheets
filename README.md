# domain-driven-design-cheat-sheets

**Your quick-read DDD guide** - because who has time to read entire books when you're trying to ship code? 🚀

Built through a lot of coffee and patience:
- Read through several DDD books and articles (check out [References](references.md))
- Collected tons of notes on the important stuff
- Spent hours with Claude Pro turning those notes into something actually useful
- Created a real-world example (Online Photo Store) so you can see DDD in action, not just theory

Think of this as the DDD cheat sheet I wish I had when starting out. Skip the fluff, get to the good parts.
